# masterThesis-results
This repository contains most of the material used in the course of my thesis project. 
Within the three folders you will find the log files obtained from the different experiment modes (2 in the simulated environment and 1 with the real robot).
The implemented tool traceGenerator and its documentation can be found at its dedicated repository: [traceGenerator](https://github.com/piquet8/TraceGenerator_Script.git)  
The last file contains the same version of the tool but produces uncompressed traces.
